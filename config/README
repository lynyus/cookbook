'xcookybooky' is a package for entering recipes
and layout them in a nice way. It has the possibility
to insert two pictures above the other recipe content.
Besides it is possible to add several recipe properties
as well as an introduction, suggestions and a hint.

This package is inspired by the 'cookybooky' package
by Jürgen Gilg, which requires some special packages
and fonts and cannot create a PDF file directly. This
limitations are reversed.

As a result of the changes not all options known
from 'cookybooky' are implemented in this package.
But nevertheless it provides some new options, e.g.
an improved color and fontsize management and more
recipe fields.


Usage
----------------------------------
The recipes are inserted in a environment. There is
the possibility to enter ingredients, preparation (steps),
(two) pictures, an introduction, suggestions and a hint.
Also there is an option to insert the recipetime,
bakingtime, portions, calory content and source of the
recipe (internet, friends, neighbours etc.). A lot of
hooks allows the user to insert content at different
locations in the recipe.
